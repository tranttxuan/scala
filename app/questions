1) Explain REST
REST is a set of rules, that when followed, enable you to build a distributed application that has a specific set of desirable constraints.

In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other.By using a REST interface, different clients hit the same REST endpoints, perform the same actions, and receive the same responses.


2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, number of servers, etc.)
In my projects, client and server establishes a connection using JSON. 

3) What are the best practices when deploying an application in the cloud
When deploying an application in the cloud, it is necessary to pay attention to
- Clearly define the purpose of the application in order to know the amount of resources is needed
- Availability of resource monitoring
- Automation (e.g. creation VMs, fault recovery, etc...)
- Security
4) What are your best strength : infra ? DB ? web ?
My best strength is website and database. I did some websites with MERN stacks.

5) Among all the projects you have worked on. Which architecture do you enjoy the most? explain why ?
